* there is such a thing as magic

[[./turtles.jpg]]

 - no one person can learn everything about a modern computer

 - the further down the stack you go, the vaguer the turtles become

 - everyone has a magic level

      "the music is ... inside the phone"
      "the chip ... switches the electricity"
      "the electricity ... comes from the power company"

* no, really, there is

[[./magnets.jpg]]

people are always pushing the limits of magic

 - we only recently discovered how lithium ion batteries degrade

 - we don't know how efficiently matrix multiplication might be done

 - we don't know why our brains are conscious!

* wizards

a wizard is just a person whose magic floor, in a particular context, you know
to be more than zero turtles deeper than yours

* ... wait, where are the women wizards?

* being a wizard is both hard and easy

it requires that:

 - you enjoy learning how things work beyond the immediate need

 - the tools you use are amenable to hacking

 - if at work: your employer is okay with the time and effort spent

(relatedly, all the rules for chess fit on a few double-sided A4 sheets)

* tools and techniques for Ruby programmers

right, back to some concrete stuff here

 - *gem open* gets you the sauce

 - *pry* and friends

 - *lsof* ... is pretty much a magic wand

 - profile, profile, profile ... see *stackprof* for Ruby 2.1
