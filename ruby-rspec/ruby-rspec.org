* why test?

Why do we write tests?  To ...

 + Find the path to an implementation (a.k.a. Test Driven Development).

 + Document the behaviour of the code under test (hence 'specs').

 + Prevent regressions in the code.

 + Explore the behaviour of legacy code.

* Test Driven Development

 + Write tests first, then make them pass.

 + Not a replacement for design thinking!

 + Can help you think through a design.

* Document Behaviour

 + Close in spirit to literate programming.

 + The prose is more important than the code.

 + RSpec even has a documentation mode.

   # TODO: examples

* Legacy Code

 + Test ideas about how legacy code works.

 + Build up a suite of tests so you can safely refactor legacy code.
