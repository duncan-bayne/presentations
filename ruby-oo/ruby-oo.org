* why OO?

 + originally intended to make programming accessible to the non-technical
   (including and especially children)

 + took over a decade to go mainstream with C++
   (not suitable for children)

 + makes certain good practices easy

* OO principles

 + abstraction

 + encapsulation

 + inheritance

 + polymorphism

* everything is a string

* polymorphism by case statement

* classes as bags o' code

* constructors that aren't

* pointless OO
