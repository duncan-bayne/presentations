* object-oriented programming anti-patterns in Ruby

"Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California."
  - Edsger Dijkstra

"Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing."
  - Rob Pike

* why OO?

 + make programming accessible to new and non-programmers
   (including children)

 + took over a decade to go mainstream with C++
   (not suitable for children)

 + makes certain good practices easy

 + particularly well suited to modelling certain real-world domains

* OO principles

 + abstraction

 + encapsulation

 + inheritance

 + polymorphism

* classes should be SOLID

 + Single responsibility

 + Open (for extension) / Closed (for modificiation)
     ... good luck with that last one in Ruby

 + LIskov substitution
   ... why programmers have a reputation as poor communicators

 + Dependency inverstion

* on to some examples

        d=[30644250780,9003106878,
    30636278846,66641217692,4501790980,
 671_24_603036,131_61973916,66_606629_920,
   30642677916,30643069058];a,s=[],$*[0]
      s.each_byte{|b|a<<("%036b"%d[b.
         chr.to_i]).scan(/\d{6}/)}
          a.transpose.each{ |a|
            a.join.each_byte{\
             |i|print i==49?\
               ($*[1]||"#")\
                 :32.chr}
                   puts
                    }

* "everything is a string"

url = 'http://example.com/resource'
=> "http://example.com/resource"

url = 'this is not a url'
=> "this is not a url"

-----

 + types are there to help you, not the computer

* use appropriate types

url = URI.parse('http://example.com/resource')
=> #<URI::HTTP:0x00000804f7ff10 URL:http://example.com/resource>

url = URI.parse('this is not a url')
URI::InvalidURIError: bad URI(is not URI?): this is not a url

* "polymorphism by if statement"

def speak(animal)
  if animal.class == Cat
    'meow'
  elsif animal.class == Dog
    'woof'
  end
end

class Cat; end

class Dog; end

speak(Dog.new)
=> 'woof'

speak(Cat.new)
=> 'meow'

* duck-typing to the rescue

class Cat
  def speak
    'meow'
  end
end

class Dog
  def speak
    'woof'
  end
end

Dog.new.speak
=> 'woof'

Cat.new.speak
=> 'meow'

* "constructors with side-effects"

class Car
  attr_accessor :engine
  def initialize
    self.engine = Engine.new
  end
end

-----

 + better hope that the Engine constructor doesn't have side effects too.

* constructor injection

class Car
  attr_accessor :engine
  def initialize(engine: nil)
    self.engine = engine
  end
end

* "inheritance"

[[./costanza.jpg]]

class Child < FamilyMember
end

-----

 + very, very easy to violate single responsibility principle

 + harder to reason about (for me, at least)

 + harder to test

* consider using composition instead

class Child
  attr_accessor :family
end

* "mothership objects"

class Bike

  def calculate_hire_price(date)
    # business logic
  end

  def book_day(date)
    # more business logic
  end
end

-----

 + more than one responsibility in a single class

 + makes understanding hard, and safe modification harder

* extract class refactoring

class Bike
  def initialize(price_catalogue: nil, booking_calendar: nil)
    @price_catalogue = price_catalogue
    @booking_calendar = booking_calendar
  end

  def calculate_hire_price
    @price_catalogue.calculate_hire_price(date)
  end

  def book_day(date)
    @booking_calendar.book_day(date)
  end
end
