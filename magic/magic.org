* there is such a thing as magic

[[./turtles.jpg]]

 - no one person can learn everything about a modern computer

 - the further down the stack you go, the vaguer the turtles become

 - everyone has a magic level

      "the music is ... inside the phone"
      "the chip ... switches the electricity"
      "the electricity ... comes from the power company"

* no, really, there is

[[./magnets.jpg]]

science is always pushing the limits of magic

 - we only recently discovered how lithium ion batteries degrade

 - we don't know how efficiently matrix multiplication might be done

 - we don't know why our brains are conscious!

* wizards

 - a wizard is just a person whose magic floor, in a particular context, you know
to be more than zero turtles deeper than yours

 - wizards are often generalised specialists

 - some have floors so low they're famous

* only one woman wizard???

* becoming a wizard is easy

it requires that:

 - you habitually look 'one turtle down' when investigating problems

 - the tools you're using are amenable to that (i.e., hacker-friendly)

 - you learn the culture

 - if at work: your employer is okay with the time and effort spent

* employee relations

 - wizards need time to lower their turtle floor

 - ... while realising that their function is to convert money into features

* tools and techniques for Ruby programmers

of secondary importance, but helpful places to start

 - *gem open* gets you the sauce

 - *pry* and friends

 - profile, profile, profile ... see *stackprof* for Ruby 2.1

 - *The Art of Unix Programming* by Eric S. Raymond

 - *lsof* ... is pretty much a magic wand
