* instrumenting and monitoring a ruby application with statsd and datadog

[[./mission-control.jpg]]

* why not?

You probably shouldn't do this.  Use an off the shelf solution like:

+ Nagios

+ New Relic

For most Rails apps, off-the-shelf solutions offer far quicker results than rolling your own.

* why?

+ simplicity

+ flexibility

+ avoid lock-in

* what is StatsD?

+ simple Perl-based server for capturing arbitrary statistics, built by Flickr

+ then re-implemented (with the same name!) in Node.js by Etsy

+ now a de-facto standard protocol with many implementations

* what is DataDog?

https://www.datadoghq.com/

+ a SaaS monitoring, analysis and alerting system

+ provides a StatsD interface ...

+ ... which means it's easy enough to jump ship if problems occur

+ plus many other integrations I won't go into here

* coding demo

* things I'd have done differently

+ instrumented more things

+ immediately upgraded my account for longer retention

+ instrumented even more things
